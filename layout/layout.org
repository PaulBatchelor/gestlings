#+TITLE: Layout
This document concerns itself with how to
arrange @!(ref "sigils" "gesture sigils")!@ on a page,
and implements an interface for doing so.

The notation style used to represent Gesture is
fundamentally a tessellation. Sigils, like tiles, are
optimally arranged on a grid. A sequence of Sigils are
threaded together with a line to form a Path.

Movement from sigil to the next can happen in 4
directions: up, down, left, right. Diagonal movement
is not permitted.

The preferred way to arrange sigils is on a spiral, with
the beginning sigil at the center. The thread (line)
connecting the sigils together outlines the sequential
order. 16 sigils create a nice even 4x4 spiral.

Movements are typically one unit away. One unit is 32
pixels. A sigil takes up the center 26x26 pixels. The
remaining pixels create whitespace.
