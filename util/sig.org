#+TITLE: Signal
This is a Lua module designed to help make managing signals
in sndkit easier.

The biggest pain point in sndkit is signal management,
or the things required to get a particular signal in more
than one place, such as a clock signal. The underlying
library for constucting audio graphs, graforge, utilizes
a buffer pool, a pre-allocated set of buffers that signals
can read and write to. Normally, this is managed transparently.
However, for signal management, buffer resources are managed
manually. Without good bookkeeping, it can be easy to produce
a virtual resource leak where buffer pools are inaccessible,
or to accidentally cause a signal to be overwritten too early.
