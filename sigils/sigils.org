#+TITLE: Gesture Sigils
* Overview
A =sigil= or =gesture sigil= refers to a combination of
symbols that come together to describe the state of a
Gesture at a particular point in time. A sigil will convey
the three main components of a Gesture: value, duration,
and behavior.

This document aims to specify a core set of sigils to work
with that can be used to unambiguously notate gesture.
Notation is generated using Janet, the built-in scripting
language for the wiki engine used here (weewiki). The
drawing library used is =btprnt=, a drawing library for
1-bit graphics.
