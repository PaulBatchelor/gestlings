#+TITLE: Runes
* Overview
Runes are the name given to the main glyph in
a @!(ref "sigils" "gesture sigil")!@. They are represented
as 7x7 1-bit tiles, and typically conform to the aesthetic
rules of Square Kufic calligraphy which impose a balance
of black and white tiles.

When rendering a Gesture Sigil, the Rune gets doubled in
size to take up a 14x14 pixel space inside of a 16x16
pixel area. The remaining pixels serve as padding.
* Tangled Files
Runes are stored in a text file format readable by
the @!(ref "loadtiles")!@ function.
