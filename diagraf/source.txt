According to some
Gestlings, we are all
made of Inspiration.

Some will even go on
to say that we originate
from the core of our
world of Cauldronia.

They call that place the
Source.

There are times when
the Devoted are lucid
and talk about the Source.

They say in their dreams,
they see a Gate. But
they dare not enter.

Kinda creepy if you ask
me though!
