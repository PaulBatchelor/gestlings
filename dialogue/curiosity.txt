All those Gestlings
over there... they are
an awfully Curious
bunch aren't they?

Most likely they are
from the Lower Rings.
Probably part of Cap's
team.

Curiosity is a very
real state of mind here
you know!

Our home on Cauldronia
was created from, and
is powered by, an
energy called Inspiration.

Inspiration radiates from
the center of Cauldronia.
We call it the Source.

As you get closer to
the Source, your dosage
of Inspiration increases.

Inspiration does funny
things to the Gestling
physiology...

We see and hear things
that aren't there. And
our dreams become strange
and vivid.

Eventually, there is an
overwhelming urge to
explore areas closer
to the Source.

We call this Curiosity.

Curious Gestlings
eventually move to the
Lower Rings and join
the Captain and their Crew.
