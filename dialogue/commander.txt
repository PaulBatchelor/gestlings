It's been weeks since the
Captain went out on a solo
trek out at sea. A fools
journey.

@block
It's that stupid myth. The
Source. It's not out there.
For years, we've tried
searching for it.

@block
We were back at shore
resupplying. Captain comes
over and relieves the crew
and myself of duty.

@block
Tells us that new facts
have come to light, and that
they need to go alone.
And that was that.

@block
Fine by me. I grow weary of
the sea. I am starting to
worry though. Cap should
have been back by now...
