Um. Hello...
...
Ugh. You caught me at
a weird time.

@block
Honestly? Not sure why
I'm down today. I'm
usually pretty upbeat.

@block
My mind is tossing
on the ocean, like some
Devoted in search of
truths with portly sail!

@block
You know what.

@block
Perhaps it's because
I ran out of Circle
Spinners to sell today.
Love those things.

@block
...
...
You don't know about
Circle Spinners?!

@block
It's the must-have toy!
Circle Spinners are tiny
mechanisms. You wind
them up, and they speak!

@block
I'd sell you one, but
like I said, I'm out.

@block
We Gestlings are clumsy
and often drop things.
Maybe you'll find one
on the ground.

@block
Well. I guess I need
to head back to the
Upper Rings. That's
where my supplier is.
