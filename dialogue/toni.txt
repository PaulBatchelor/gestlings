I'll be honest. I don't know
why I am so sad. I'm really
tired of being sad. Tired of
being tired of being sad.

Look! Gestle-Reeds! Ripe for the
plucking. Warmth from
Cauldronia! I've got it
all!

I wasn't always like this.
People told me I was funny.
Really! I don't know
what happened.

Oh well. Maybe I should
go to the upper rings.
That usually cheers me up.
