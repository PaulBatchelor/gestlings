I'll be honest. I don't know
why I am so sad. I'm really
tired of being sad. Tired of
being tired of being sad.

Look! Grass! Ripe for the
plucking. Warmth from
the Springs. I've got it
all! But. Instead I'm sad.

@block
I wasn't always like this.
I used to tell jokes.
Really! I did! I don't know
what happened.

Oh well.
