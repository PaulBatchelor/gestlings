@# Gestletree

Did you know you are
standing on top of a
tree? We all are!

All Gestlings reside
somewhere in the
Gestletree.

We call this tree the
Gestletree, and it
sacred to us.

When Cauldronia was
first forming, the
Gestletree was only
a mere sapling.

It is said when the Early Settlers
emerged from the Springs,
they used the leaves from
this Sapling to dry off.

The Settlers learned
how to cultivate this
tree, and helped make
it grow.

The Gestletree is
divided into parts.
You're in Gestleton, the
top of the Tree.

As you make your way
into the Gestletree, you
will reach the Upper and
Lower Rings Districts.

Below that, and you hit
the Shores, which is
where you can get to
the Springs.

But uh, I wouldn't
go to the Shores. It
isn't safe there...
