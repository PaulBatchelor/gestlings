... how about now?
@normal
does it work now?
Okay good. You're awake.

@normal
@block
First thing: hello, don't
be afraid.
Second thing: Wow, you look
terrible.

@block
It looks like your mind has
conjured up a train, which
isn't far off from what is
actually happening.

@block
You are dead. Sorry to break
it to ya. When lifeforms
like you die, well, they
usually go somewhere else.

@block
Somehow you ended up here.
Not sure how. I guess
things get jumbled up
sometimes.

@block
So, uh, you are, very,
VERY far away from home.
Lightyears away. Literally.

@slow
@block
And... how to put this...

@slow
@block
...you're not quite "you"
anymore...

@normal
@block
You're kind of on another
plane of conciousness. A
different form of energy.

@block
Don't be so sad.
There really wasn't all that
much to your reality
anyways. Just sayin.

@block
I suppose there's not much
going here, either...

@block
Well, I guess this is your
stop. Cauldronia. Home
of the Gestlings. I'm
from here too actually!

@block
I've made some modifications
to your wetware. You should
be able to understand them
and perceive their world.

@block
It's made from spare parts,
so it's not a stable system.
I'd probably keep
it to light conversation.

@block
Actually you know what?
Maybe just let them talk.
They love to talk about
themselves.

@block
Don't panic! This is only
temporary. I'll sort this
out at HQ. I'll be back
soon. Just wander around.

@block
Okay then. On a schedule.
See you soon. Bye!
