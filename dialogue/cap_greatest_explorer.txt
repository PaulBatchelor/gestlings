@# Cap, the greatest explorer.

I can't help but notice
you eyeing that mechanism
over there.

Nobody knows what it does.
We found this on one
of our expeditions beyond
the Shores.

It was a dangerous trip.
We nearly capsized.
Luckily, the Captain
knows the sea well.

I don't know where we'd
be without The Captain.
Probably the greatest
explorer in our history.

Captain likes to go by
"Cap" on land. Things
get more formal on the
water.

The shores and beyond
are dangerous...

Some Gestlings get ideas
in their head. They go
alone and they go out
too far.

They go missing...
