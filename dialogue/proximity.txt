Do you feel that tingle?
Right here is a hotspot
for Inspiration, the energy
that created Gestlings.

It's hard to measure
Inspiration, but they say
it gets stronger as you
go down the Gestletree.

Gestleton and the Upper
Rings are pretty high
up, so you don't feel
it much here.

The Lower Rings is where
you start to feel it.
That's where all the
Devoted reside.

The Shores are at the
bottom of the Gestletree.
It's very strong there.
And very dangerous.

Gestlings who stay too
long at the shores are
at risk of overexposure,
and can get the Fade.
