It has been said that
the Devoted who stay
too long in the Lower
Rings develop Curiosity.

Curiosity is a result
of too much Inspiration.
It drives them to want
more Inspiration.

When they are lucid,
they describe an
irresistable voice
that calls to them.

They are drawn to
the Shores, where they
are doomed to succumb
what we call the Fade.

The Fade is a kind of
draining. It starts slowly.
A trickle of a loss of
self. Then, an ocean.

Eventually, the Fade
will consume everything.
And then they simply
vanish.
