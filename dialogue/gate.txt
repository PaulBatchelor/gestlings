Cap goes on and on about
that Gate. The Gate of
Cauldronia. They believe
it actually exists.

They say it's the opening
to the Source, the
birthplace of all
Gestlings.

In Gestling Lore, that
is where we are created.
We all go through that
gate, never to return.

From there, we float
up to the surface, where
we wind up at the Springs.

Before they left, Cap
said they made a big
breakthrough about the
location of the Gate.

They went by themselves,
which is strange. It's
dangerous to navigate
the waters alone...
