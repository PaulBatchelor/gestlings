the Mushroom Forest in
the Upper Rings.

which mushrooms were
edible.

mushroom and it made
their face all puffy.

take one cookie each...

After camp ends,
Cap says they are
planning a solo trip
beyond the shores.

@nphrases 4
@block
I know Dad says I'm
too young to visit the
shores because it is
too dangerous.

@nphrases 4
@block
When I grow up, I want
to be like Cap and
live on the shores
and explore Cauldronia!

@nphrases 2
@block
I wonder what Cap hopes
to find out there...

@nphrases 3

Anyways, miss you lots.
See you in a few weeks!
