Last week, Captain took
us out camping over by
the Mushroom Forest in
the Upper Rings.

We went on a nature
trail and Cap showed us
which mushrooms were
edible.

their face all puffy.

After camp ends,
Cap says they are
planning a solo trip
beyond the shores.

I know Dad says I'm
too young to visit the
shores because it is
too dangerous.

When I grow up, I want
to be like Cap and
live on the shores
and explore Cauldronia!

to find out there...
