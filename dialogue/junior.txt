Dear Mom,
Sorry for not writing
back sooner. Camp has
been really really fun!

@block
Last week, Captain took
us out camping over by
the Mushroom Forest in
the Lower Rings.

And then, Cap showed us
how to make a fir
And then we had milk
and cookies.

We were each supposed to
take one cookie each.
But I took two.

And then...

Bobo told a
funny story about this
one time they got stuck
in Gestleton.

We laughed so hard.
Bil laughed so hard it
made milk come out
of their nose HAHAHA!!!

And then...

We were taught a folk
song from the
Lower Rings.
It goes like this.

AND. THEN.

We went back home.

Cap says they are
planning a solo trip
beyond the shores.

I asked Cap if we could
go to the Shores too, but
Cap said we are too
young.

I guess they have a
mission to find the
Entrance? Not sure what
that is.

Anyways, miss you lots.
See you in a few weeks!
