@# A dialogue about the gestlings

It seems like you haven't
met many Gestlings in
your travels, no?
That's too bad...

We Gestlings are small
folk. Created right
here on Cauldronia!

We are made deep inside
the hot molten core,
and then we surface
from the Depths below.

We only know this because
occasionally a new Gestling
will pop up from the
Springs occasionally.

Gestlings are made of
pure Inspiration, an
energy that flows
throughout the Universe.

Hmmm... anything else
you should know about
Gestlings?

Well, we can be quite
chatty. Expect to get
chatted at! We don't
get many vistors here.
