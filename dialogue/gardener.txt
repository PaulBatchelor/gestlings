Hello, gentle traveler,
I can't say your arrival
is an unexpected one.
I've been watching you.

I guess you could say
you have found what
you call The Source,
but that is not its name.

You are standing in the
Hall of Was. Birthplace
of all Gestlings, and
many other things...

In this hall you'll see
a small garden. It has been
my honor to take care of
this for an age.

No, I did not create
the Gestlings. But, I
did help out! In a way,
they are like my children.

Unfortunately, I am
unable to leave my post.
I must observe my little
Gestlings from a distance.

There used to be more of
us here. The Garden used
to be larger. Inspiration
used to be more abundant.

Do not fret, gentle traveler.
It is the law of our
universe to decay.

I did the best I could
for them...  given the
circumstances...

They seem happy.

I wish I could have done
more for them... but
now I am old and tired. I
hope they are content.
