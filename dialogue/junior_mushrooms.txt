Here is a poem Cap taught me to
help remember which mushrooms
are edible and which are poisonous:

To eat a mushroom off a tree
One must choose quite carefully
For if you pick a tainted shroom
A single bite could mean your doom!

Stay away from pink and red
A single lick will make you dead
Black and green with leaves of four
Take a handful, eat some more!

While purple stripes look quite delicious
their poison venom can be vicious!
Shiny and white, with gold polka dots
Lucky find; Rare, and worth lots!
