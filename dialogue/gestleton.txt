@# Gestleton

Duh-dun-nu-nuhh!
Welcome To Gestleton!
Home of the Gestlings.

Well, okay. Technically.
Gestleton is just one
of the regions where
Gestlings live.

But it's the best!

I've been here since
I popped into existence.

Gestleton is the oldest
town in Cauldronia,
established by the Early
Settlers ages ago.

Gestleton is perched
at the very top of
our beloved Gestletree,
where all Gestlings live.

It is the best because
it is on the top floor!
