Do not be afraid,
gentle traveler, of
the Gestlings in the
Lower Rings.

You may find that some
of them you won't be
able to understand.

We call these Gestlings
The Devoted.

They have dedicated their
lives in search of
meaning. Our origin. The
Source.

The Inspiration down
here is quite strong.
They are drawn to this
location.

Years of high inspiration
exposure have caused
their minds to change.

At some point, they start
speaking a new language.

We don't know much about it,
but they say it is ancient
tongue, spoken by our
creators.
